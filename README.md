## Problem statement:
 * To develop a model that can detect the plant disease with precision and to develop an user application  which makes use of the developed model.

## User Application link: https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/course/~gsbnaidu/

## Project Type
  * Replicating an advanced research paper
  * Analysis or comparison of established techniques using experiments
  * Deployment and application development around an ML model or pipeline

## Data sets to be used 
  * PlantVillage Dataset (https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset)

## ML Techniques to be used
  * Random forest classifier
  * L2 regularized logistic regression
  * Decision Tree
  * Adaboost Decision Tree
  * Voting Classifier(Ensemble Learning Model of the above three)
  * Deep learning model
